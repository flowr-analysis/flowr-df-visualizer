# The dataflow visualizer Visualizer

To run the project, you need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

1. Run `npm ci` to install all required packages (only once or after updates)
2. Run `npm start` to start the server
3. Open the URL shown in the logfile (probably something like <http://localhost:8080/>)
4. Work, work, work! :D
